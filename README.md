# 🛡️ Cyber Risk Learning Journal

Welcome to my Cyber Risk Learning Journal! This repository is a personal space where I document my journey in learning and growing as a cyber risk professional. It includes daily reflections, notes on frameworks and tools, case studies, and curated resources.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Deepen my understanding of cyber risk management
- Explore key frameworks like NIST CSF, ISO 27001, and FAIR
- Analyze real-world cyber incidents and extract lessons learned
- Build familiarity with tools used in risk assessment and threat detection
- Track progress toward certifications and professional goals
